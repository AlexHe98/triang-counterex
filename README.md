Counterexamples for triangulations
----------------------------------

This repository contains source code for finding counterexamples for
one-vertex 3-manifold triangulations by using Pachner moves to remove
distinguished edges.

The code is written to run using Regina's regina-python command-line program.
For details on how to install Regina, visit https://regina-normal.github.io/.
See below for usage notes.

We currently recognise three types of distinguished edges:
* **Core edges**: Deleting a solid torus neighbourhood of such an edge leaves
    behind another solid torus. The existence of a core edge implies that the
    triangulation represents a lens space.
* **Tunnel edges**: In an ideal triangulation of a knot complement, deleting
    a small regular neighbourhood of such an edge turns the knot complement
    into a genus-2 orientable handlebody. The existence of a tunnel edge
    implies that the knot is either trivial or has tunnel number one.
* **Edges isotopic to Seifert fibres**

The main scripts in this repository are:
* ``removeCore.py``: Attempts to remove a core edge.
* ``removeTunnel.py``: Attempts to remove a tunnel edge.
* ``removeFibre.py``: Attempts to remove an edge isotopic to a Seifert fibre.
* ``simplifyNoCore.py``: Attempts to simplify a triangulation without
    introducing new core edges.
* ``simplifyNoTunnel.py``: Attempts to simplify a triangulation without
    introducing new tunnel edges.
* ``simplifyNoFibre.py``: Attempts to simplify a triangulation without
    introducing new edges isotopic to Seifert fibres.

The bulk of the supporting code can be found in ``search.py``,
``removeBadEdge.py`` and ``simplify.py``.

The script ``removeCore.py`` takes three command-line arguments:
* An isomorphism signature for the triangulation from which we would like to
    remove a core edge.
* The number of concurrent processes to use.
* The number of seconds to wait before printing a brief progress update.

In the following example, assume that the regina-python command-line program
is in the directory ``dir``. To use 4 concurrent processes to remove a core
edge from the triangulation with isomorphism signature "cMcabbgqs", and to
request a progress update every 10 seconds, run the following:
> ``dir/regina-python removeCore.py cMcabbgqs 4 10``

The scripts ``removeTunnel.py`` and ``removeFibre.py`` are similar, except
that ``removeFibre.py`` takes two additional command-line arguments:
* The first additional argument is mandatory, and must be either ``ult`` or
    ``int``. This option controls how the search measures the complexities of
    the triangulations that it encounters.
    - If the argument is ``ult``, then the search tries to simultaneously
        minimise the complexity of all bad edges, since the *ultimate* goal
        is to remove all such edges.
    - If the argument is ``int``, then the search instead focuses on an
        *intermediate* goal: reducing the number of bad edges by one.
    
    For details, see the ``complexity()`` routine in ``removeBadEdges.py``.
* The second additional argument is optional. If provided, this must be a
    comma-separated list (*without* whitespace, e.g. ``1,6,8``) of integers
    corresponding to indices of bad edges. In this context, an edge is bad if
    it *might* be isotopic to a Seifert fibre; we emphasise that we do not
    conclusively test whether edges really are isotopic to Seifert fibres.
    This means that even if we have already identified edges in the initial
    triangulation that are not bad, we cannot reliably recompute which edges
    these are; the optional argument allows us to include this information as
    part of the input.

The scripts ``simplifyNoCore.py``, ``simplifyNoTunnel.py`` and
``simplifyNoFibre.py`` each take four command-line arguments:
* An isomorphism signature for the triangulation that we would like to
    simplify.
* The number of concurrent processes to use.
* The number of seconds to wait before printing a brief progress update.
* The allowed excess height (i.e., the amount by which we are allowed to
    increase the size of the input triangulation).
